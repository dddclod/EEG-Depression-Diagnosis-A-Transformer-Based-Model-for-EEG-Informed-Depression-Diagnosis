# Research-on-Depression-Diagnosis-Algorithm-Based-on-EEG-Multi-Attention-Mechanism
This project leverages EEG-based deep learning for objective depression diagnosis. A custom Transformer with dynamic brain-region weighting and cross-frequency attention achieves 94.3% accuracy on the MOMDA dataset, improving interpretability and outperforming CNN, LSTM, and SST-EmotionNet baselines.
